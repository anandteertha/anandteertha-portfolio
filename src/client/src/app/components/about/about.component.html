          <h3>Who I Am</h3>
          <p>
            I'm a software developer passionate about Rust and systems programming. Currently, I'm building 
            <strong>Neatd</strong>, a Rust CLI application for automated folder organization that emphasizes 
            type safety, explicit error handling, and safe filesystem operations.

          <h3>My Focus</h3>
          <p>
            I'm actively seeking opportunities in Rust development. My work focuses on creating CLI tools 
            and systems software that are both performant and maintainable. I believe in writing code that 
            is correct by construction, leveraging Rust's type system and ownership model.

          <h3>Current Work</h3>
          <p>
            I'm currently working part-time as a Software Developer at the Khayrallah Center for Lebanese 
            Diaspora Studies at NC State, where I build web applications using React, FastAPI, and pytest. 
            I also implement stress testing using Locust to ensure system reliability.
